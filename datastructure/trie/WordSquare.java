/**
 *
 * Given a sequence of words, check whether it forms a valid word square.
 * A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the k^th row and column read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).
 * 
 * Notes:
 *   The number of words given is at least 1 and does not exceed 500.
 *   Word length will be at least 1 and does not exceed 500.
 *   Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z.
 *   
 * Example1
 * Input:  
 * [
 *   "abcd",
 *   "bnrt",
 *   "crmy",
 *   "dtye"
 * ]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation:
 *   The first row and first column both read "abcd".
 *   The second row and second column both read "bnrt".
 *   The third row and third column both read "crmy".
 *   The fourth row and fourth column both read "dtye".
 * Therefore, it is a valid word square.
 * 
 * Example2
 * Input:  
 * [
 *   "abcd",
 *   "bnrt",
 *   "crm",
 *   "dt"
 * ]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation:
 *   The first row and first column both read "abcd".
 *   The second row and second column both read "bnrt".
 *   The third row and third column both read "crm".
 *   The fourth row and fourth column both read "dt".
 * Therefore, it is a valid word square.
 * 
 * Example3
 * Input:  
 * [
 *   "ball",
 *   "area",
 *   "read",
 *   "lady"
 * ]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation:
 *   The third row reads "read" while the third column reads "lead".
 * Therefore, it is NOT a valid word square.
