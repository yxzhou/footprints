 *
 * By simple, we mean that the regex can only contain special character:
 *   * The star means what you'd expect, that there will be zero or more of previous character in that place in the pattern.
 *   . The dot means any character for that position.
 *   + The plus means one or more of previous character in that place in the pattern.
